# COSC-499-Git-Exercise
Individual Git Exercise by Philip Okanlawon:

This program does a simple user survey.

It begins by displaying a greeting to the user.

It then prompts for, and saves the user's first and last name, then prints a welcome message to the user.

Next, it asks the user for it's age, and passes the user input to a "user" method.

The user method takes in age input and displays a message to the user, letting them know whether they are of a legal age or not.

The program ends by displaying a thank you and goodbye message.
